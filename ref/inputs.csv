### Updating project files
You will need to have an IDE installed in order to modify the python scripts. These steps use the git commands that can be run in command line, however you can use the desktop github application to make updates more easily.
1) Pull down the project using the steps in the [installation](#installation) section. 
2) Create a new branch using this command: `git checkout -b branch-name`
3) Open and modify files where the changes need to be made. 
4) Once the changes are done and the scripts have been tested and work as expected, commit these changes to the branch using this command: `git commit -a -m 'Description of changes'`
   - You can continue working out of this branch until all changes you want to do are done, or move to the next step and redo this process later for additional changes
5) Merge your changes to the `master` branch run the following commands:
    ```git
    git checkout master
    git merge branch-name
    ```
   - Note that if you made changes to a file at the same time as someone else merge conflicts may happen, these can be dealt with using additional commands
   - For more information on [Git Commands](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging)
